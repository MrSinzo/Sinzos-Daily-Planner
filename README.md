## What is it? <a name="what"></a>
Here is a fun interactable web app that will allow the specific user to quickly organize the classrooms events. 


## Why did I make this? <a name="why"></a> 
Decided to try out more react components and create a front-end application that was quick and easy to use and load. I also made this moile responsive so that any other of the Para-educators or Subsitutes have an easy access to the generic schedule of the classroom. 


## How did I go about building this? <a name="how"></a>
Mainly used React and React-draggable component. I oringinally was attempting to get the buttons to be craggable via CSS but react may posing some complications on how vanilla CSS works in react. Then it was Deployed to Github pages.
