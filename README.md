## What is it? <a name="what"></a>
Here is a fun interactable web app that will allow the specific user to quickly create classrooms events with icons or small photos and will all save to local Storage. It uses a draggable Box feature to move around the created cards for the kids to move and interact with on a smart board!


## Why did I make this? <a name="why"></a> 
Decided to try out more react components and create a front-end application that was quick and easy to use and load. I also made this mobile responsive so that any other of the Para-educators or Subsitutes have an easy access to the generic schedule of the classroom. 


## How did I go about building this? <a name="how"></a>
Mainly used React and React-draggable component. I oringinally was attempting to get the Activity Cards to be craggable via CSS but react may posing some complications on how vanilla CSS works in react. Then it was Deployed to Github pages.
